# Rock Paper Scissors Javascript game

This is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors which was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript with Bootstrap framework. It is a one page site that allows the user to input a username at the start via a modul and then play the game. The game is played by choosing rock paper or scissors shown by the images on the screen.

Once the player makes their selection the computer selection is also randomly generated by javascript and the winner is selected by comparing the selections.
The score and the image of the girls face changes according to the results which will be investigated more in the game features section.

# User Stories

## Target Audience

The target audience simply is anyone wanting to play an easy to understand game of rock, paper, scissors.

#### Visitor goals

- As a user, I want to be able to recognise what the game is.
- As a user, I want to easily understand the concepts of the game.
- As a user, I want to know my score vs the computer score.
- As a user, I want to navigate the games controls easily.
- As a user, I want to easily see who is winning.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![alt text](assets/images/readme/palletescreenshot.png)

The colour scheme is very basic with two major colours blue and yellow for the graphics. This was to keep the game from looking too busy, especially on smaller devices which makes it easier to navigate and separate the different sections.

### Typography

I went for a google font Bangers because it looked clean and modern and was easy to setup. Below is a screenshot of the font.

![alt text](assets/images/readme/typography.png)<br>

### Imagery

Due to the nature of the project it is not image intensive however I sourced images for the girls reactions in the vs tab from pexels, I thought it would make the game more interactive and quirky with her expression changing if the user lost or won. I tried to display old school comic book style images. I edited all the images that I sourced using photoshop.

### Wireframes

### Desktop view - start-up screen

### Desktop view - the first screen shown to the user when the page loads (shown above). The footer was later taken off in the actual to make the game look less busy

### Tablet view

I used Balsamiq to design my wireframes.

## Features

### Landing page

![alt text](assets/images/readme/firstscreen.png)<br>

The game is only one page with a popup modal automatically set to appear when the page is loaded. The modal contains the rules of the game and a text area for the player to enter their name.

### Popup modal with rules and form for players name

This is a bootstrap modal that pops up automatically on the loading of the homepage.
The user can read the rules of the game in the modal and then enter their name to start.

### Top menu bar

This contains 3 buttons of:

![alt text](assets/images/readme/screenshot_buttons.png)

### Restart game button

The restart game button resets all the variables to their start stage.
Namely:

- The round score and game score to zero of both player and computer.
- The lightning bolt images of both player and computer.
- The computer choice and user choice image resets to a question mark image.
- The image of the girls face resets to the start image.
- The text above the girl face image resets to the text 'Lets play rock paper scissors!'
- The user name if entered does not change, only refreshing the page does that, thereby popping up the modul and prompting the user to enter a name again.

### Rules button

When the user clicks on the rules button a popup similar to the one at the start pops up with the game rules. The only difference is there is no form requiring a username.

"Sound on/off" toggle button.

This button toggles between a "sound on" and a "sound off" state, muting the two mp3 files listed at the bottom of the html.
The text then reflects what the user should push on or off for their desired choice.

![alt text](assets/images/readme/screenshot_user_score3.png).\
Games one view with lightning bolts that reflect the score. (shown above)

### Computer game score, round score and lightning bolt

![alt text](assets/images/readme/screenshot_computer_score.png).\
The exact same block is shown on the opposite side of the screen, the only difference is the word computer instead of the user name.
No more screenshots added of this image changing as it is the same as the users functionality and would be redundant.

### Changing facial expression image with appropriate text of who wins and how

There are 4 different states of the images, static when the game starts, a win, a lose and a draw.
Each of these are reflected in the text above the image and the girls expression to match.
These images are shown below.

### The 3 option images for the player to select: rock, paper or scissors

### Two alert boxes for a win or a lose

___

### Future Implementations

- A scoreboard that logs the username and their score will be later implemented.
- More options could later be added to the game such as spock and lizard.
- A button option to share the game on Facebook and other platforms.
- The popup modal at the start needs to be improved so if the username is missing they are not allowed to play, and that the player can push enter after entering their name instead of clicking on the button.
- When the player hovers over the selection images of rock paper or scissors they will have a css animation.
- The alert boxes when a user wins or loses could be replaced with better looking popup modals.

### Accessibility

Added aria labels where needed.

## Bugs

The lightning bolts do not reach the 5th bolt for some reason. Even though it reflects it in the score, needs to be fixed.
The scores do not align on the computer side.
