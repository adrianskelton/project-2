## Target Audience

#### Visitor goals

- The main goal is to let the user play rock paper scissors.
- The user should understand the rules of the game and play it easily.
- The user should ee able to easily navigate the controls of the game.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme is very basic with two major colors dark grey for the text and blue for the graphics. This was to keep the game from looking to busy espesially on smaller devices.

### Typography

I went for a google font Bangers because it looked clean and modern and was easy to setup. Below is a screenshot of the font.

### Imagery

Due to the nature of the project it is not image intensive however I sourced images for the girls reactions in the vs tab from pexels, I thought it would make the game more interactive and quirky with her expession changing if the user lost or won. I tried to display old school comic book style images. I edited all the images that I sourced using photoshop.
