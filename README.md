# Rock Paper Scissors Javascript game

This is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors which was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript with Bootstrap framework. It is a one page site that allows the user to input a username at the start via a modul and then play the game. The game is played by choosing rock paper or scissors shown by the images on the screen.

Once the player makes their selection the computer selection is also randomly generated by javascript and the winner is selected by comparing the selections.
The score and the image of the girls face changes according to the results which will be investigated more in the game features section.

## Resubmission notes

As this is a resubmit I addressed the points for failure by making the code more my own, while at the same time adding functions that I made such as the googly eyes that follow the mouseover two buttons. I also changed the scoring system as suggested by my mentor to clean up the code and fixed the lighting scoring system not displaying correctly. This is described in the bugs fixed section. I believe these changes alone improved the game visually and of course functionality by working correcly. I also added functionality to hide certain html sections by targeting their ID's, the game was remade to play until the computer or player reached 3 winning rounds.

The alert popups were also changed to html that is displayed once the user won or lost which is hidden or revealed with javascript by targeting elements in the domain and checking what stage the game is in (if other functions have been run and the game is still running or ended/paused so these messages will then be hidden or based on this)

# User Stories

## Target Audience

The target audience simply is anyone wanting to play an easy to understand game of rock, paper, scissors.

#### Visitor goals

- As a user, I want to be able to recognise what the game is.
- As a user, I want to easily understand the concepts of the game.
- As a user, I want the game to be simple and fun
- As a user, I want to know my score vs the computer score easily.
- As a user, I want to navigate the games controls easily.
- As a user, I want to easily see who is winning.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![alt text](assets/images/readme/palletescreenshot.png)

The colour scheme is very basic with two major colours blue and yellow for the graphics. This was to keep the game from looking too busy, especially on smaller devices which makes it easier to navigate and separate the different sections.

### Typography

I went for a google font Bangers because it looked clean and modern and was easy to setup. Below is a screenshot of the font.

![alt text](assets/images/readme/typography.png)

### Imagery

Due to the nature of the project it is not image intensive however I sourced images for the girls reactions in the vs tab from pexels, I thought it would make the game more interactive and quirky with her expression changing if the user lost or won. I tried to display old school comic book style images. I edited all the images that I sourced using photoshop.

### Wireframes

### Desktop view - start-up screen

![alt text](assets/images/wireddesktopstart.png)

### Desktop view - the first screen shown to the user when the page loads (shown above). The footer was later taken off in the actual to make the game look less busy

### Tablet view

I used Balsamiq to design my wireframes.

## Features

### Landing page

![alt text](assets/images/readme/firstscreen.png)

The game is only one page with a popup modal automatically set to appear when the page is loaded.

### Popup modal with rules and form for players name

This is a bootstrap modal that pops up automatically on the loading of the homepage.
The user can read the rules of the game in the modal and then enter their name to start.

![alt text](assets/images/readme/headerscreen.png)

### Top menu bar

This contains 3 buttons of:

![alt text](assets/images/readme/screenshot_buttons.png)

### Restart game button

The restart game button resets all the variables to their start stage.
Namely:

- The round score and game score to zero of both player and computer.
- The lightning bolt images of both player and computer.
- The computer choice and user choice image resets to a question mark image.
- The image of the girls face resets to the start image.
- The text above the girl face image resets to the text 'Lets play rock paper scissors!'

**Functionality change of restart game button**

- When the game is over I had to make an if statement checking if the player had pushed the quit game button. This was because a lot of elements that were present before to be reset are now hidden and will bring up errors, so if they player clicked on the quit button the game will reload using the location.reload(); code and the page will refresh. Otherwise it will run the script and set all the variables to their default start game state if they player has not clicked on the quit game button.

### Rules button

When the user clicks on the rules button the rules popup modal pops up.

### "Sound on/off" toggle button

This button toggles between a "sound on" and a "sound off" state, muting the two mp3 files listed at the bottom of the html.
The text then reflects what the user should push on or off for their desired choice.

---

### User and computer score and lightning bolt

![alt text](assets/images/readme/screenshot_score.png)\
User score with 4 points and computer with none. (shown above)

### Changing facial expression image with appropriate text of who wins and how

There are different states of the images, static when the game starts, a win, a lose and a draw. Then there is the image with glasses when the round is won or lost that has an animation effect that changes the image depending on if the mouse is hovering over the 'play again' or 'quit' button.

Each of these are reflected in the text above the image and the girls expression to match.
These images are shown below.

### Screenshots of a round win and loss

### Future Implementations

- A scoreboard that logs the username and their score will be later implemented.
- More options could later be added to the game such as spock and lizard.
- A button option to share the game on Facebook and other platforms.
- When the player hovers over the selection images of rock paper or scissors they will have a css animation.

### Accessibility

Added aria labels where needed.

## Bugs

### Bugs fixed

**Problem:** The lightning bolts do not reach the 5th bolt for some reason, they only show 4 lightning bolts when it should be 5 to reflect 5 points.\
**Solution:** Called the changeLightning() function from the winGame() function forcing the bolts to update.

**Problem:** When I ran my quitmessage function this caused the hardreload function to stop working properly as there was now html ID's that were hidden and trying to be targeted by the hardreload function.\
**Solution:** I had to make an if statement in the hardreload function to check if the quitgame function had been run. If it had been it would just use the "location.reload();" option instead of running the code affected by the hidden html.
